				<p>LibraryBox is designed to enable the distribution of digital information to areas with little or no Internet access, even off the grid. It does so using open source software and very inexpensive hardware, allowing the distribution of digital information at a far lower cost than other solutions. If you'd like to learn more about the LibraryBox Project, please visit http://librarybox.us when you get back to the Internet.</p><br /><p>LibraryBox is designed to be safe and secure. No logins are required and no user data is logged. The system is purposely not connected to the Internet in order to prevent tracking and preserve user privacy.</p>

					<h2>Thanks</h2>
			<p>LibraryBox v2.0 would not have been possible without the support of the Kickstarter Backers, all of whom are listed below. Thanks to Matt Neer at the Lake Forest Library for being the first to see the promise of the project. I’d also like to thank Ross Singer for the coding help when I knew that something was possible but didn’t have the language needed to do it, and Andromeda Yelton for yet more coding help, editing, and making sure I didn’t sound like an idiot (much). Development of basically all of the good parts of the v2.0 release are due to the incredible coding talents of Matthias Strubel and the UI work of David Brooks. Finally, thanks to Bo Baker, cinematographer extraordinaire, and puts up with listening to my hair-brained schemes far too much.
