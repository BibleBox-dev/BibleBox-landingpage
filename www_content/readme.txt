BibleBox is a self-contained wifi file server that is built with open source code and commodity hardware. The reference hardware that it runs on (the TP-Link MR3040) has its own builtin battery providing you with a portable digital resource distribution tool (books, video, audio...anything, really) The entire package can fit in a pocket.

BibleBox was created by Campbell Smythe (http://www.cdsmythe.com) and the code behind it is free and open source software. More about the BibleBox project can be found at http://BibleBox.org

BibleBox is a fork of the Librarybox project, by Jason Griffey using Piratebox software which was created by David Darts and is registered under a Free Art License (2011). To learn more about the PirateBox project, please visit http://wiki.daviddarts.com/piratebox
